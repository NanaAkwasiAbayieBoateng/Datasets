After day one, it is very obvious that is not the case.  FCA has a knack for having high turnover on its supervisors; I was number 35 in my department just since 2009.  The reason that there is such high turnover is that none of the mid-level management team has the backbone or the brains to get anything done.  So, to cover their own hides, they push all of the blame on their reports, making a very unpleasant situation for everyone involved.  But it doesn't stop there.  Unions are a wonderful thing, but the UAW has crippled any chances of bettering this organization.  So, as a supervisor you must deal with your managers who believe that yelling at a fire will put it out, and you must also deal with the people who report to you who are completely immune from any and all consequences.

My roll was to make sure the proper part was put on the proper car without touching any tools or parts.  This job was incredibly inefficient and should have been automated.  When I approached my boss and suggested that we could eliminate a large amount of waste in this position there was always push back because ""this is they way we have always done it"" cultural attitude.  It was difficult to be creative and truly feel apart of progress when all progress is stifled by layers of middle management.  It always felt like everyone was always scared to make a decision as an individual because they could be wrong.  I felt that the large number of drawn out regular meetings reflected this lake of personal accountability.",Standard Auto Industry

A typical day at work consisted of checking emails, voice mails and texts that may have received from dealers and or customers; reviewing individual cases, writing notes on how to handle the case and then finally reaching out the dealers to let them know what our plans are. Depending on the situation, we would have to determine how much time we are going to spend on a case. Some decisions on cases would need the consent of a team lead. What I learned was the importance of team work and attendance. Because our job consisted of working with our own customers and dealers, our attendance was very important and if a case manager was out on vacation or sick, we would have to help with the load and contact their customers and dealers before contacting our own. However, this was also something that I did not like. When someone was missing, a few of my coworkers would complain about it and would dim the mood. Having a positive attitude was essential for this job. The workplace was amazing. I loved my coworkers from my team, my team lead and even the dealerships that I would have to contact.

1,Machine Repairman,2016-12-11,Current Employee,"Kokomo, IN","A great place to make a lot of money while sales are strong, if you are willing to put in the overtime. Unfortunately, downturns in sales sometimes result in layoffs and new hires or low seniority employees will most likely be stuck on the ‘C’ crew of the AWS system. This is the 10 hour per day, 4 days per week, alternating between day and night shift.The attendance program is strict.Since Chrysler was obtain by Fiat, we operate by WCM. World Class Manufacturing’s lean principles are utilized more intensely than our old TPM system. It is forcing needed improvements in communication, training, preventive and predictive maintenance. Continuous improvement is one of the core focus points, in theory. In practice, it all comes down to the daily part counts and making the daily build rate. If production will not release a machine for PM’s during the week, maintenance has to be scheduled on weekends. Because we have a policy of balanced hours for each tradesman, and not everyone wants to work overtime, often repairs are done by tradesmen working outside their normal departments on machines they are not familiar with. This presents a challenge and sometimes has less than satisfactory results. Sometimes ‘band-aids’ applied will correct a problem temporarily, but if the root cause is not corrected, greater damage will eventually occur. The old saying “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is sometimes overused.Overall the people here are good to work with. As for maintenance supervision, there has been a shift over the years of rather than bringing them up through the trades, the company","Overall, it’s been a great opportunity and career."

While this saves the company money in salaries paid, other costs and consequences are incurred when unnecessary or wrong repairs are directed by inexperience.Having a good amount of patience and keeping oneself busy will serve you well.

The machining departments are considerably more laid back in general.",More time spent at work than with family
3,Supervisor,2016-12-07,Current Employee,"Belvidere, IL",you will work two Saturday's in a row to have one Saturday off. Not considerate of your family life. If hired you have to understand how seniority works. There are two types; plant and corporate. Corporate is when you start with the company and plant is the plant you start at. Ex. say you start with the company in June of 2000. If you get laid off and have to goto another plant you will have day one seniority although another person could have started with the company in 2005. Since you were relocated if they did another layoff you would get laid off before them. It's a different world in the plant life.,Upper management/HR

He claimed to be open-minded about hearing what everyone had to say about possible improvements, but he was more like a broken record with all of the times he said it and never implemented anything. He's big on favoritism with two ladies and one salesman on the ""team."" It seemed like the rules didn't apply to them, so they generally did whatever they wanted whenever they wanted to. Don't get me wrong, I don't think he is a bad individual, I simply hope he comes to the realization that he needs to change his ways or he is going to lose a lot of hardworking employees.The sales team as a whole are generally some of the best people you could ever meet. They're relatable, welcome, and they are willing to work hard to get people into the vehicle they want. They're at work from opening to close, and sometimes they don't even get time to eat because they're working on a deal and they want the best for someone they'd probably met only an hour or so ago.The service team is amazing and they work themselves to the bone, getting parts in and out, as well as making sure the variety of services were completed in a timely manner. It can take a bit longer because the department is on the smaller side, but they would rather perform the correct maintenance on a vehicle and go over time making sure everything is 100% than to let someone leave with subpar work.",Decent Business but Management Needs Work

9,Production Unit Leader,2015-07-03,Current Employee,"Warren, MI","On paper (and in your interview), this sounds like an ideal situation. Solid base salary, four days on, three days off with the ""occasional added production shift ""as demand dictates."" I am telling you now since no one told me, ""demand"" will dictate quite often. It is nothing to work 15-20 days straight at 12+ hours/day. It is also easy to put in 140+ two week pay period without blinking. As for the workplace/culture of a unit leader, you are expected to fit 13 hours of tasks into a 10 hour shift thanks to your very useless ""support"" departments that serve no other function than to add work to your plate. Oh, and this is in addition to your actual job of keeping the production line running/directing manpower. Of those departments, I would rate the safety team the worst. They are required to do nothing involving actual plant safety, as all projects, medical investigations/passes and safety tours are expected to be completed by (you guessed it) production unit leaders. The safety team as well as the other support teams do nothing but compile reports to present to the plant leadership of what tasks the unit leader was unable to accomplish.The operations management is an abomination as you will not find standardized instruction to be the same across multiple shifts. Edicts/mandates from corporate to tackle issues such as work-life balance and salary retention often are ignored by the operations team which includes production center management.As I said, take this job if you want, but don't read this review and later say no one told you so.",Not the smartest decision you will ever make...

12,MATERIAL HANDLER,2015-06-27,Current Employee,"Sterling Heights, MI",Two years of working for Chrysler brought me nothing but stress and physical illness. The management is horrible and unfair. The plant that I spent the majority of my time working in was extremely unorganized and management cares nothing about their employees.  Easily comparable to Evilene's Sweatshop.  The only good part was getting paid weekly.,Mistreated
13,Assembley/Fork Lift Driver,2015-06-26,Former Employee,"Fenton, MO 63036","A typical day at work in Chrysler as an assembler was busy, sometimes hard, but fun because you were working with co-workers who had become  like family to you because you worked with them all the time, everyday. You learned a variety of jobs within the plant and everywhere you worked you became friends with somebody. The hardest part of the job was learning a different one if you had to go out of your designated area. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you met someone new in different areas that you end up becoming friends with. The management staff were down to earth because in most cases, they were from the assembly line also.",Chrysler is one of the best auto companies to work for.

20,Lead DRE for powertrain cooling plumbing,2015-06-15,Current Employee,"Auburn Hills, MI","The knowledge and traits that Chrysler has taught me are strong work ethic, dependability, positive attitude, and being team oriented.  Working cross team with other departments to meet dates and cross functional component compatibility means personal skills and a positive attitude. We are working towards one goal and that is safe dependable cars for consumers. If there is arguing or no team playing there would be an even bigger time crunch.  The managerial staff is extremely busy with all the new programs so self motivation,multi-tasking, effective communication, and confidence are all imperative. This is not only to get your work done to hit bench mark program milestones but to be able to communicate confidently about new component timing, issues, or plant concerns and relay these factors to a busy manager that seems to only has minutes in-between meetings. Chrysler has a very helpful work environment; anyone will stop and help if you have questions. Managerial staff will stand behind there employees decisions and designs. Co-workers are also helpful and for the most part proud and excited about their jobs.  Hardest part of the job would be rushed timing and process issues. Everything needs paperwork and the paperwork has to travel past so many hands that if someone doesn't feel like doing their job, you have to physically go see them or send an email to their manager which in turn is a loss of even more time to complete a task. Another pitfall is pay grade compared to the responsibility and work load.",Helpful Management but rushed timing

1,Business Unit Leader (Area Manager),2015-02-05,Former Employee,Kokomo IN,Chrysler was very demanding of management time.  The position I held required me to be on call 24/7 overseeing 3 shifts of UAW employees.  A typical day started with morning meeting with Team Leaders to what issues carried over from the provisos shifts.  I would walk the floor and see what machines were down from the previous shifts and coordinate with maintenance a priority on what need attention first.  Afternoon carryover meeting with current shift Team Leaders and Second shift Team Leaders provided a good opportunity for discussion on issues that occurred during the day.  This allowed for a smooth transition and helped set priority to second shift on what would need attention first if any.  The hardest part of the job was coordinating maintenance activities due to the large amount of machines in the dept and the schedule that assembly would be currently running.

3,Production Unit Leader,2015-02-04,Former Employee,"Belvidere, IL","Amazing at how much disrespect is handed down to the Supervisors by people who have zero to little experience in leading others. Typical day at work is spent begging other areas to provide you with people to start the line because the Union makes it so easy for people to call off from work. Not sure how this plant still runs, oh wait, yes I do, it is because of the hard work and creativity the supervisors have in filling the gaps of people and broken equipment only to get treated like cra* by upper management when build isn't made. If your not putting in 70+ hours a week then you have no future in this company. Pay was good but overall treatment wasn't worth the headache. The Union runs this plant and gets many of the low life trouble makers that work there out of any responsibility for their actions as possible. I worked here for 3 months and was doing really well, but again, the disrespect I felt by upper management and the lack of authority we have over the workers made me feel like I was fighting with my hands behind my back. In addition, after 3 months with around 900 hours under my belt, I earned a WHOPPING 10 hours of vacation time.. WHAT A JOKE. There is no balance between work and family. During my time here I knew 3 people who were having serious marital problems due to the lack of them being home with the family, fortunately I am financially secure so I didn't need to put up with the nonsense for as long as they have.

19,Process Lead,2014-11-04,Current Employee,"Tipton, IN","Chrysler is becoming more competitive in the auto-industry with the merger with Fiat. Although the company is moving in the right direction, there are some major issues with the implementation of World Class Manufacturing as the operating methodology for the company. This is mostly due to the long standing culture that Chrysler has formed over is existence as an American auto-manufacturer. As it is well known, change is the hardest barrier to overcome in a company and this is something that Chrysler is still struggling with. The hardest part of working for Chrysler is probably the complete lack of work/life balance. For a single person who is looking to earn good money and isn't looking for a work/life balance. It is a good place to work. If you are looking to have a family, some amount of free time, and the ability to move into positions that are desirable based on skills, knowledge and experience, Chrysler probably isn't the place you are looking to work for.","Very Good Salary, Low Work/Life Balance, Decent Place to Work"

That’s the proof ;)They will tell you it not for everybody, that’s CODE for it’s not for anybody.

7,Chassis Engineer ,2013-06-25,Current Employee,"Auburn Hills, MI","I decided to move to Michigan when my fresh out of college position wanted to bind me into a Non-compete agreement, I had a pending offer from Chrysler that would offer me the high level experience of a lifetime so I took the opportunity. I was placed on the newest platform Chrysler had just started developing, I worked day to day on taking the design proposals and molding them into ultimately tangible parts that were then tested, optimized, sourced, and sent down the production line and are on cars on the road today. Many of my Co-workers were older, near my fathers age I felt that some treated me  me with the respect as which they would show their offspring, but others would treat you as if you were the register worker at the supermarket. I started at Chrysler as a purchased service contract worker but was promoted a short time later to a Supplemental employee. I seemed to have gain the respect of more senior management at Chrysler faster than some other employees, I feel that this is strongly because of my clear communication, organization, and how I can relate aspects of my past employments towards this position. You are constantly tasked to interact with a multitude of people every day, not all in the same group either, being that all components must meet targets of cost, function, thermal,shipping, timing, weight, NVH..ect.

Which would leave you with your actually position to do outside of the normal working hours. Most given weeks on any given day I will arrive between 5:30-7:00AM work until 9:00AM have meetings until ~3:00-4:00PM and then begin my work. The hardest part of my job was actually doing my work, finding time to do the work that needed to be completed while prioritizing requests from the more senior senior management who seek information so they may report it to their senior management. I also found it hard to implement change, I understand I do not have a multitude of experience AT Chrysler but I found many occasions where I would arise a potential issue and it would be more or less put aside until the 11th hour.

I was determined to give 110%! _0 Unfortunately, it was one of the worst employment experiences I have ever encountered. The assembly manager was distant and had few leadership team building skills. She was more concerned with the number of suggestions submitted in comparison with her peers. The launch manager was verbally abusive, antagonist and a sabotager. There were no office supplies available. We purchased our own. Computer systems were unreliable. There was one printer for the entire department that worked only part of the time. No systems training. Minimal Corporate expectations training. If we raised questions we were told to read a book or look it up online. Equipment did not work. The average work day was 14 hours, 9 hours production...the rest trying to compile production numbers from 3-4 sources and waiting for the production meeting to start. I had several years manufacturing experience including the skilled trades, this was not my first rodeo. I lost what respect I might have had for the lauch manager when he assured us there was bonus money in the works. I finally had enough when the LM added the handbuilt convertible line to me.

14,Joint Local & Technical Training Facilitator,2012-10-09,Former Employee,"Kokomo, IN","A typical day at Chrysler started by assessing the machines in my work area, once I knew the state of the machines was good, I would begin production. Quality control and maintenance were a vital part of the daily routine too. Each day was different. If the machines were running well the productivity was good. If the machines were breaking down then the overall production depended on the availability of maintenance & parts to get the machines running. My co-workers were usually very competent and knowledgeable, as well as likeable, most had great work ethic. The hardest part of the job was never knowing when a machine would break down or how long it could be to get it up and running. If the machines ran well, most jobs were easy and production targets were easily achieved. When the machines were down the job was always harder and management was looking to you (the operator) for answers. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was producing quality parts and the friends I made.","Manufacturing facility that was unpredictable, sometimes challenging, but mostly enjoyable to work at."

Sometimes very verbally abusive in front of my sub-ordinates.All other supervisors were sympathetic to the stress and pressure applied to the assembly line supervisors and became dependant on each other. The hardest part of my job was covering over 1/4 mile of assembly line to make sure all jobs were being performed properly.The most enjoyable part of my job was developing relationships with the assembly line workers and gaining their trust and respect.,Had the priviledge to be one of the first people in starting up a new plant.
